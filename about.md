## WTF?

How many times have you asked:\
*"WTF was that command or query or link that did that thing?"*\
*"WTF is this thing talking about?"*\
*"WTF was that cool tool that did that thing"*\
*"WTF is that important concept I was trying to remember"*\
*"WTF is that awesome meme called"*

Enough that I started creating this.

So here is where I try to put those things so it doesn't take me so long to answer the question of WTF?

I may also start making posts & ranting here.
