## TL;DR

* Power BI Datasource security sucks
* [Web.Contents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/web-contents) has an API Key section, but it only applies if the API Key is part of the URL/URI
* If you use a header to authenticate, it has to be hard coded.
* The other only option is to make a custom connector, which is too hard and overkill for something like this.
