## TODO

* [ ] Think about how you want robots.txt setup
* [ ] consider staticman or using github issues (or better yet github discussions) for comments on blog posts
  * [ ] <https://bartoszgorka.com/github-discussion-comments-for-jekyll-blog>
* [ ] Decide if we are keeping FrontMatter CMS or not
* [ ] Try and configure front matter categories to make a YAML list not a JSON Array
