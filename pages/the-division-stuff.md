## Sharing Items

From: <https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/sabzjq/i_dont_understand_sharing_items/>

> Division 2 loot share works like this:
>
> You can only share items with the person(s) who have been in your group the moment you've acquired it. Also you can share items you've got from caches with people that have been in your group when you acquired the cache.
>
> You can share those items 1h\[hour\] after acquiring. After that the item becomes unshareable and is yours to do whatever.
>
> When you share an item, it gets dropped from your inventory into the game world and anyone, who is eligible to pick up the shared item, can do so.
>
> Any item dropped from your inventory (shared) and picked up by someone else, is lost to you. Unless they give it back in that 1 hour sharing for said item is available.
