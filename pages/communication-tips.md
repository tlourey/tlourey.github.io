## Techniques

### Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)>

1. BLUF: Bottom line up from
2. 3 Whats:
   1. What?
   2. So what?
   3. now what?
3. Anything longer that a page should have an attachment (either a memo replacing it or supporting evidence)

### Minto

Searching for Minto Pyramid example (which is technique / strategy) lead me to:\
<https://awware.co/blog/pyramid-principle/> - haven't read it in full but it seems good

## Audiences

### Execs

1. We are we asking them to do
2. Why/Justification (don't use the word why)
3. What are getting out of (more reasons than why) - Use the heading benefits.
4. Limits
5. Finances
6. Summary/Rec (ideally the same as point 1 / BLUF)

Communicate in elevator terms.
Use most appreciate terms for the audience.
Consider Optics.
Consider the way people process information - don't force them to use a lot of effort to figure out what your *asking*

### Managers

* making statements/points/sentence less awkward ie the sentence is not ambiguous just difficult to get what is the subject and what is the object of the sentence.
* "these" is a pronoun but the noun is too far away or non existent.  Ie these what?
* loops in syntax e.g. "There are several services that are only available to services"
* Consider if a reply of significance contains editorialising - if so:
  * make sure it doesn't contain too much
  * only necessary points - as long as it doesn't say get fucked - don't bother with light humor
  * an aside that looked like snipe - thinly disguised snip
  * don't loop back over conversation
* consider if some reply's should just be a phone call
