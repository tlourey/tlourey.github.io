## Techniques

### Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)>

1. BLUF: Bottom line up from
2. 3 Whats:
   1. What?
   2. So what?
   3. now what?
3. Anything longer that a page should have an attachment (either a memo replacing it or supporting evidence)

### Minto

Searching for Minto Pyramid example (which is technique / strategy) lead me to:\
<https://awware.co/blog/pyramid-principle/> - haven't read it in full but it seems good

## Audiences

### Execs

1. We are we asking them to do
2. Why/Justification (don't use the word why)
3. What are getting out of (more reasons than why) - Use the heading benefits.
4. Limits
5. Finances
6. Summary/Rec (ideally the same as point 1 / BLUF)

Communicate in elevator terms.
Use most appreciate terms for the audience.
Consider Optics.
Consider the way people process information - don't force them to use a lot of effort to figure out what your *asking*

### Managers

* making statements/points/sentence less awkward ie the sentence is not ambiguous just difficult to get what is the subject and what is the object of the sentence.
* "these" is a pronoun but the noun is too far away or non existent.  Ie these what?
* loops in syntax e.g. "There are several services that are only available to services"
* Consider if a reply of significance contains editorialising - if so:
  * make sure it doesn't contain too much
  * only necessary points - as long as it doesn't say get fucked - don't bother with light humor
  * an aside that looked like snipe - thinly disguised snip
  * don't loop back over conversation
* consider if some reply's should just be a phone call

## Misc Tips

### Perceptual Positioning

1st - I, me, & my
2nd - You, Your
3rd - We, us, our, they and them

Give people a sense of choice:

* "What name would you like me to call you?"
* "Where do you want to meet?"
* "Does that make sense?" instead of "Do you understand?"

<!--- 
  • Capitalise Aboriginal
  • Capitalise Indigenous
  • Err on over capitalisation
  • Consider capitalisation of C in Country

  • Aboriginal person, not Aborigine

  • Always try to choose word that has the most possible acceptance

  • First Nations  or First nations person

  • Try to use the language the recipient(s) uses

  • More respectful not to use acronyms
  • Don't use ATSI
  • Don't abbreviate Aboriginal

  • Say Does that make sense instead of do you understand
