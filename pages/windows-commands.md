## Uptime

Find Uptime from System Info

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> The below records the time system last registered a **full** boot up.
> If you have FastBoot enabled, it doesn't reset.
> Task Manager shows you the 'duration' of your uptime from this date, not the actual duration - ie hibernation doesn't stop this
