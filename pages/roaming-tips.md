## Bias and Background

* TBC

## eSims

* Most of them don't do voice roaming, just data
* If you're already using an esim, you need to check what your device supports
* Most devices can have multiple eSims stored but only newer devices can have 2 eSims active.

### 2 eSims active

> [!NOTE] Active vs using
> I am using the word active specifically. This section is about having 2 eSim's *active* at the same time but not *using* 2 eSim's at the same time. There is a difference between *active* and *using* and *simultaneously using*

* iPhone 13 or later[^1]
* iPhones without a physical tray[^1]

## Using vs Simultaneously Using (aka DSDA vs DSDS)

DSDS: Dual Sim Dual Standby: Device supports 2 sims and both are active and registered with the mobile network but only **one** can be used at a time. You can't call off one sim and sms off another at the same time. More commonly, you can't use data off one sim and make calls off the sim at the same time. Most devices support DSDS.

DSDA: Dual Sim Dual Active: Both sims can be used simultaneously. Data off of one, calling off of another? Yes. Dual data connections? Technically use but I wouldn't *automatically* expect your bandwidth to double and I doubt your phone will be able start <ins>bonding</ins> the two links together. Your milage may vary.

## Data Saving Tips

### Android Users

* Turn on Data saver (Basic)
* Turn off Sync (intermediate)

### Apple Users
