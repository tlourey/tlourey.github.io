## Time doesn't update

Notice your time isn't automatically updating or seems super out? A reboot should fix it, but if not:

Quick Fix:

1. Go to Control Panel --> General --> Date and Time
2. Turn **off** set time and date automatically (if it was already off that is your problem, if not continue)
3. Turn it **on** again

Long term fix:

Caveats:

* Issue with MacOS Sonoma
* Should be fixed in 14.5 but I had it occur again on 14.7
